# React Tutorial with CoffeeScript

I went through the [React Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) and substituted CoffeeScript for JavaScript and CJSX for JSX, used [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io), and this is the result.


## Usage

- `git clone`
- `npm install`
- `npm start` to create `public/build.js` and start the express server


## Editor

If using [Atom](https://atom.io), first `apm install react` to get proper syntax highlighting for JSX and CJSX files.
